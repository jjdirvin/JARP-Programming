# JARP-Programming

Current TODO List

Rename Domain template

rename <prog> with own start symbol
- in viewtree.tlp and interpret.tlp


model.sml
- user-defined supported types
- add update store, access store, etc

interpreter.sml
- add a print Model(not required but useful for debugging)

typechecker.sml
- need to write typeCheck and typeOf

semantics.sml: what we mess with
- pin down constants in the trees
- write E and M stuff
- Instructions in the file itself are useful
